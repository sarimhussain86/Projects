This project is available in Dataquest website, URL: "https://app.dataquest.io/m/99996/web-scraping-nba-stats-in-python/1/project-overview"
Note some of the important instructions to navigate through different files I have uploaded:
1. All CSV files were downloaded from the Python scripts written in .py files
2. The code written in "mvp_html.py" Python script downloads multiple web pages from the URL given.
3. The web pages downloaded from "mvp_html.py" script are used by the "mvp_table.py" file to download the required table.
4. The resulting tables are appended and downloaded as "mvp_all_season.csv".
5. Same steps (2 - 5) for files:
   -- "player_stats.py", "stats_table.py" and "player_stats_per_game_all_seasons.csv"
   -- "team_stats.py", "team_table.py", "team_standings_division.csv" and "team_standings_expanded.csv".
6. Note that I have downlaod 2 CSV files from "team_stats.py", this is because many people download the Division table from the website, The expanded table
   has a lot of information about teams because of which I have downloaded this table as well. You can choose whether you want both tables or any 1 of them,
   edit the code in "team_stats.py" to adjust according to your requirement. 
   -- Other than that the expanded table also required some data transformation to make its contents simpler. The data transformation is performed in the same
      script the table is downloaded from i.e, "team_stats.py".
